## ü§ù Contributing

Code changes can fall into the types from the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

### Types

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- **build**‚Äîchanges that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).

- **chore**‚Äîother changes that don‚Äôt modify src or test files.

- **ci**‚Äîchanges to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).

- **docs**‚Äîdocumentation only changes.

- **feat**‚Äîa new feature.

- **fix**‚Äîa bug fix.

- **perf**‚Äîa code change that improves performance.

- **refactor**‚Äîa code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.

- **revert**‚Äîreverts a previous commit.

- **style**‚Äîchanges that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).

- **test**‚Äîadding missing tests or correcting existing tests.

### Branches

Branches are created from `main` and can follow the naming convention below. For common types, see [Types](#types).

Convention:

```shell
type/description

type(scope?): description  #scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: "/", "\" and ",")
```

Example:

```shell
