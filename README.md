### Why we built it

- There are many blockchains out there, each with great assets and communities
- The future is definitely multi-chain!
- However, the User eXperience of interacting with multiple chains is cumbersome
  - Multiple wallets need to be created and navigated by the user
  - Tokens need to be swapped around, also by the user
  - It is so easy to make a mistake, lose out on an opportunity, or simply get discouraged

### What we built

- Cross-chain NFT renting experience
- With simple and straightforward UX
- No matter what chain and which wallet or tokens you have
- You can list and rent NFTs on multiple chains, without the multi chain hassle

### How we built it

- We have created NFT renting contracts for lenders and renters
- We have deployed the contracts on Polygon and Moonbeam
  - [Mumbai Polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x8c787c95e9f1bbc6153336571b7ab58cd57ad98c)
  - [Moonbase Alpha](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/token/0xec19ebb094269b2782fbab3b5ce6e3cb4dea86a2)
- Mixed in some Axelar magic to make the contracts **cross-chain BFF!**
  - [Axelar dashboard](https://axelar.network/)
- Sprinkled SwingXYX to automate token conversion for payments and collateral between ETH and GLMR
- Designed UI where Lenders and Renters do not need to worry about blockchain details

## üíª Get Started with Conveyr _locally_ in 5 minutes

To run the dev environment you'll need to start the local blockchains in the `./protocol` directory in a separate terminal.

`cd ./protocol && npx hardhat run ./scripts/dev.ts`

The script will output details about each supported chain. You'll need to add the local chain networks to your Metamask. Take note of the `rpc` and `chainId` values that print out for each chain. They look like this:

```js
{
  name: 'Polygon',
  chainId: 2500,
  gateway: '0x186038359000c32da660ecA49C3d494001A30Ffe',
  gasReceiver: '0xe90560ba227BA579eb4D883abe73E85a9123a615',
  constAddressDeployer: '0x69aeB7Dc4f2A86873Dae8D753DE89326Cf90a77a',
  tokens: {},
  rpc: 'http://localhost:8500/0',
  tokenName: 'Matic',
  tokenSymbol: 'MATIC'
}
```

Open the settings in Metamask and choose "Networks", click "Add Network". For each local chain choose a name and enter the `chainId`, `rpc`, and the `tokenSymbol` values and click "Save".

Next, you'll need to add a wallet to these new networks. In the output of the local blockchains you'll see a list of ten wallet keys with the balance. Copy the `privateKey` of the first wallet. In Metamask, click the avatar in the top right and choose "Import Account". In the dropdown, choose "Private Key" and paste the `privateKey` from the local blockchain output. Repeat this step for each local blockchain.

```js
[
  {
    address: "0x716dE4a2cfa56eB3E682D6f418Ac4A52F9F535aB",
    balance: "999999999999.978545215973228486",
    privateKey:
      "0x7d8ec2ecb35763d264acda56859719bd7f222a0d3cc0f18d5716ccb25138b691",
  },
  "etc...",
];
```

Now that you have the local blockchains set up and your Metamask is configured to interact with them, you can start the dApp's local server. Change directories to the `./client` directory in a new terminal window and start the server with `npm run dev`. Make sure that your Metamask in on one of the local blockchain networks.
